# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

NuSEDS (National Salmon Escapement Database) stores salmon escapement survey records, spawner abundance estimates, and the linkages between them for Pacific Region salmon populations [@openCanadaNuSEDS]. The NuSEDS estimate Types 1--6 are intended to communicate the statistical reliability and interpretability of those estimates, but the current table-only guidance is often applied inconsistently across operational groups, and it does not capture the full context needed for public interpretation.

## Hyatt (1997) intent and foundation

Hyatt (1997) developed a draft, hierarchical escapement classification key intended to be "unambiguous, easy to apply and reliable" for both field personnel and informed data users [@hyatt1997]. Hyatt framed classification around three linked dimensions: (i) properties of the survey and analytical methods used, (ii) statistical properties of the estimates (units of expression, accuracy, and precision), and (iii) the level of documentation supporting the estimate.

The NuSEDS estimate type table is derived from this foundation, but the table-only representation can be read as a method lookup and leaves ambiguity about how to incorporate breaches/bypass, timing, infilling, combined methods, and other common real-world complications.

## Estimate type summary (Types 1--6)

```{r type-summary-table}
type_summary <- data.frame(
  Type = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
  Label = c(
    "True abundance (high resolution)",
    "True abundance (medium resolution)",
    "Relative abundance (high resolution)",
    "Relative abundance (medium resolution)",
    "Relative abundance (low resolution)",
    "Presence or absence"
  ),
  Units = c(
    "Absolute abundance",
    "Absolute abundance (often with uncertainty)",
    "Relative units (index, within-series)",
    "Relative units (index, within-series)",
    "Relative units (uncertain)",
    "+ / -"
  ),
  Interpretation = c(
    "Direct total count with negligible missed fish and minimal adjustment.",
    "High-quality, standardized estimation with qualified accuracy and (where available) quantified precision.",
    "Consistent, high-effort relative index; accuracy/precision not fully quantified but stable enough for within-series comparisons.",
    "Lower-effort relative index; comparability limited and sensitive to conditions (timing/visibility/coverage).",
    "Method unclear, inconsistent, or poorly documented; may still support presence/absence but weak for numeric comparisons.",
    "Non-numeric confirmation of adults present/not detected with reliable species identification."
  ),
  check.names = FALSE
)

csas_kable(
  type_summary,
  escape = TRUE,
  bold_header = FALSE,
  font_size = 8,
  align = c("c", "l", "l", "l"),
  caption = "High-level summary of estimate Types 1--6 as originally intended by Hyatt (1997), using short descriptors for orientation."
) |>
  kableExtra::column_spec(2, width = "3.0cm") |>
  kableExtra::column_spec(3, width = "3.0cm") |>
  kableExtra::column_spec(4, width = "7.5cm")
```

## Why an update is needed now

Meeting discussions and task-team notes highlight several recurring problems:

- **Inconsistent application across groups**: the same nominal estimate type can be assigned to methodologically different estimates, leading to misinterpretation by public NuSEDS users and DFO staff outside the producing group.
- **Modern method coverage**: imaging-sonar approaches have been used for escapement estimation (e.g., DIDSON deployments), but are not always clearly represented in legacy table-only guidance, encouraging ad hoc interpretation [@holmes2005didson].
- **Threshold sensitivity in downstream use**: estimate types are used as data-quality filters in Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) rapid status assessments; estimates above the filtering threshold are screened out, affecting pathway selection and confidence rating [@holt2009_058].
- **Metadata gaps**: key qualifiers discussed repeatedly in meetings (survey timing relative to run timing, breach extent and infilling approach, observer reliability, and calibration of historical estimates) are not consistently captured in public-facing metadata.
- **Open-data and transparency initiatives**: the Pacific Salmon Data Portal and related Open Government releases provide an opportunity to clarify guidance and better encode expert knowledge directly in metadata, reducing reliance on informal, person-to-person interpretation [@dfoPacificSalmonDataPortal; @openCanadaNuSEDS].

## What this report provides

This report documents an updated, Hyatt-aligned guidance implementation that:

- Preserves Hyatt's Types 1--6 while making eligibility rules explicit.
- Separates **enumeration methods** (field data collection) from **estimation methods** (analysis and modelling).
- Uses a property-first decision sequence that begins with a data-format gate and a method-known gate before method-family checks.
- Records downgrade flags for common failure modes (e.g., breaches/bypass, coverage/uptime, visibility, documentation) and applies final documentation and precision/accuracy checks.
- Encodes the key as machine-readable YAML and executes it consistently via an R engine and a Shiny application.

## Scope

This report documents classification logic, evidence expectations, and implementation wiring. It does not evaluate biological status or re-interpret escapement beyond assignment to Types 1--6 and associated downgrade flags.
