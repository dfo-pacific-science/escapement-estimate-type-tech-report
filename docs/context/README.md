## Optional local context files

This folder is intended for **optional, non-public or bulky context files** used to populate some crosswalk tables during rendering.

If you have the NuSEDS data dictionary CSV available, place it here:

- `docs/context/Data_Dictionary_NuSEDS_EN.csv`

If the file is not present, the report will still render, but the affected tables will fall back to placeholders.
